1. What is a regular expression and how does it work?
A regex is a text string of characters that define search patterns. They allow you to search text to find words, numbers, etc that match whichever search pattern has been specified.
2. What is an array and how does it work?
An array is a collection of items stored contiguously and of the same type. Arrays are probably the most commonly used data type because of the ease of finding items within arrays based on their index. We can easily add, remove, insert, sort, etc when using arrays to store data. Random access and caching is also easier with arrays.

3. What is a hash table and how does it work?
A hash table is a data structure that behaves similarly to an array. They are more effecient than other table data structures, being they function off of key-value pairs, making it more simple to access indexes and perform all the functions listed above for arrays. What makes hash tables unique is their use of hash functions to come up with an index that is mapped to a value : key-value pairs. Collisions need to be accomodated so indexes don't end up with more than one key.
